Fullstack development is a blurred term, in means, in a simple sentence, the capability of a developer to work
both on frontend and backend without a preference. Of course, there are lot's of different interpretations and defition
of the tearm, as I've found a frontend[backend]-fullstack dev (one who does fullstack but prefers frontend [backend]).

In the last few years, I've joined a small italian company and I was required to do both frontend and backend development,
and in this period I develop some competencies on this field and I'd like to share in this post my work tools.

# Tools

## Angular

Angular is currently my preferred framework to build web apps, I not a fanboy, I like also React and other framework and
I'm experimenting with that. Angular was trivially the first frontend framework I learned and I've a good experience with it.

## Nx Workspace

I do fullstack development with Nx monorepo. The idea of monorepo is to have all the code of a project (frontend, backend, microservices, etc.)
shared within a single repository. That's very usefull in order to maintain strong dependecies across projects
that are deployed separatelly and make it more easy to write integration tests among various services.

After some experimenting with different monorepo approaches, I found [Nx](https://nx.dev/) by [Nrwn](https://nrwl.io/)
the favorite one. It's still not free of issues but it's a good compromise and simplify a lot the development!

**nx** is a tool build on top of **Angular Cli** (**ng**), and inherit some usefull tools of _ng_ like schematics that I love very much.
Moreover, it provides a good project structure even with big projects.

## GraphQL and GraphQL code generator

GraphQL is a typed language to write API, a great tool for GraphQL developer is Graphql Code Generator, a system that
allows you to automatically generate typescript types from your graphql types
